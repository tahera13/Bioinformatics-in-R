### Questions
1. What are the last twenty nucleotides of the DEN-1 Dengue virus genome sequence?
2. What is the length in nucleotides of the genome sequence for the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae strain TN (accession NC_002677)?
3. How many of each of the four nucleotides A, C, T and G, and any other symbols, are there in the Mycobacterium leprae TN genome sequence?
4. What is the GC content of the Mycobacterium leprae TN genome sequence, when (i) all non-A/C/T/G nucleotides are included, (ii) non-A/C/T/G nucleotides are discarded?
5. How many of each of the four nucleotides A, C, T and G are there in the complement of the Mycobacterium leprae TN genome sequence?
6. How many occurrences of the DNA words CC, CG and GC occur in the Mycobacterium leprae TN genome sequence?
7. How many occurrences of the DNA words CC, CG and GC occur in the (i) first 1000 and (ii) last 1000 nucleotides of the Mycobacterium leprae TN genome sequence?

### Questions
1. Draw a sliding window plot of GC content in the DEN-1 Dengue virus genome, using a window size of 200 nucleotides. Do you see any regions of unusual DNA content in the genome (eg. a high peak or low trough)?
2. Draw a sliding window plot of GC content in the genome sequence for the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae strain TN (accession NC_002677) using a window size of 20000 nucleotides. Do you see any regions of unusual DNA content in the genome (eg. a high peak or low trough)?
3. Write a function to calculate the AT content of a DNA sequence (ie. the fraction of the nucleotides in the sequence that are As or Ts). What is the AT content of the Mycobacterium leprae TN genome?
4. Write a function to draw a sliding window plot of AT content. Use it to make a sliding window plot of AT content along the Mycobacterium leprae TN genome, using a windowsize of 20000 nucleotides. Do you notice any relationship between the sliding window plot of GC content along the Mycobacterium leprae genome, and the sliding window plot of AT content?
5.  Is the 3-nucleotide word GAC GC over-represented or under-represented in the Mycobacterium leprae TN genome sequence?
